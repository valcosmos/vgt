# vgt


## Description
A CLI tool for quickly creating my own Vue3 template and React18-template. 😊

I build it just for fun, it is still in progress. 🤭

And the template, it's just the most concise state right now, nothing has been added. And I will continue to update and integrate more configurations for ease of use at work. 😏
